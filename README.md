LegiAble Lite is a cognitive accessibility layer for the web.

Origins

Built initially during a 6-hour hackathon (Top 8/200 participants) in October 2025

Hackathon v0 included:
	•	OCR image-to-text converter
	•	Dyslexia reading ruler
	•	Workplace dyslexia simulation
	•	Accessibility action quiz

Why I Rebuilt It

The web app required manual uploads and didn’t scale across browsing behavior.

So in Jan 2026, I rebuilt it as a Chrome extension focused on:
	•	Global font override (OpenDyslexic)
	•	Lightweight reading ruler
	•	Blur-based cognitive focus mode
